          <p >I am a Northcoders Software Engineering bootcamp graduate with a background in Accounting. After graduating in Accounting, I experimented with short coding courses through Code Academy before joining Northcoders and this decision is what sparked my interest to become a developer. With plenty of transferable skills from Accounting (e.g. critical thinking, organisation skills, technical skills) as well as an intensive 13 weeks of skills built up during the bootcamp, I am excited to start a career as a Software Developer ðŸš€ </p>
